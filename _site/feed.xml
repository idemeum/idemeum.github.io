&lt;p&gt;Identity plays a major role in everyday life. It’s the key that determines the particular transactions in which we can rightfully participate as well as the information we’re entitled to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in a world that’s increasingly governed by digital transactions and data, our existing methods for verifying someone’s identity are far from adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  In 2019 alone financial losses due to identity fraud totaled $1.9B
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the meme “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog”? It was drawn by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog&quot;&gt;Peter Steiner&lt;/a&gt; and published by The New Yorker on July 5, 1993. It is still as true today as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs/idemeum-verified/idog.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cartoon implies the ability to send and receive messages — or to create and maintain a website — behind a mask of anonymity. “Nobody knows” is there because Internet protocols require no user to confirm or prove one’s own identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are situations where identity proofing is not required or is even undesirable (use cases where anonymity or pseudonymity is required), there are others where it is important to reliably establish an association with a real-life subject. Examples include obtaining health care or executing financial transactions. There are also situations where the association is required for regulatory reasons (the financial industry’s ‘Know Your Customer’ requirements, established in the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or to establish accountability for high-risk actions (changing the release rate of water from a dam).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;When accessing some low-risk digital services, “being a dog” is just fine; while other, high-risk services need a level of confidence that the digital identity accessing the service is the legitimate proxy to the real-life subject.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-do-we-verify-digital-identity&quot;&gt;When do we verify digital identity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question let’s take a look at the simplistic diagram of identity lifecycle and get some terminology in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs/idemeum-verified/lifecycle.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can access any service, I need to prove my identity so that a credential can be created, and I can be enrolled as valid subject within the identity system. Therefore, &lt;mark&gt;identity proofing&lt;/mark&gt; is all about establishing that an applicant is who they claim to be. At this point I will also create an authenticator (password, PIN, certificate, etc.) that will be linked to my digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I return to the service, I need to provide reasonable risk-based assurance that I am the same person who previously accessed the service. Hence, &lt;mark&gt;authentication&lt;/mark&gt; establishes that a subject attempting to access a digital service is in control of one or more valid authenticators associated with the subject’s digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, once I am authenticated, the service needs to know what privileges I can be granted. &lt;mark&gt;Authorization&lt;/mark&gt; helps with that, as it is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;So, identity proofing typically happens at &quot;before&quot; phase. However, it would be also useful to extend the trust all the way to &quot;during&quot; phase, so that when the user returns to the service, we not only assure that he has a valid authenticator in possession and control, but also assure his identity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-identity-verification-work&quot;&gt;How does identity verification work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When identity proofing is done, it needs to be done at a certain “Identity Assurance Level (IAL)”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov&quot;&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)&lt;/a&gt; sets requirements for each of the 3 &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html&quot;&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;, based on the required security level and assumed risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;IAL1&lt;/mark&gt;: There is no requirement to link the applicant to a specific real-life identity. Any attributes provided in conjunction with the authentication process are self-asserted or should be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;IAL2&lt;/mark&gt;: Evidence supports the real-world existence of the claimed identity and verifies that the applicant is appropriately associated with this real-world identity. IAL2 introduces the need for either remote or physically-present identity proofing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;IAL3&lt;/mark&gt;: Physical presence is required for identity proofing. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized and trained representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of identity verification is progressing across 3 phase. First, the document and additional context need to be &lt;mark&gt;collected&lt;/mark&gt;. Second, the supplied information is &lt;mark&gt;validated&lt;/mark&gt; to make sure the documents are valid, not expired, or forged, etc.. And finally, the identity is &lt;mark&gt;verified&lt;/mark&gt; by matching the document with the photo supplied by the subject. At this phase, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liveness.com&quot;&gt;liveness detection&lt;/a&gt; is typically performed to make sure the system is interfacing with a physically present human being and not an inanimate spoof artifact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-do-we-do-identity-verification&quot;&gt;Where do we do identity verification?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote identity proofing services are becoming more and more prevalent across online services. Service owners, especially in the financial industry, are integrating identity verification product in order to minimize the impact of ID fraud, which has been steadily increasing recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, things are quite different on the enterprise identity side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  71% of surveyed enterprises reported password lockout issues and sign-in challenges
  &lt;footer class=&quot;blockquote-footer mt-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hitachi-id.com/cgi-bin/emaildoc?document=identity-and-access-management-trends-during-covid-19.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hitachi ID survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprises are still leveraging insecure methods as it relates to digital identity onboarding and proofing. Credentials are distributed over email or SMS, or often times managers print them and distribute physically. Even when magic links or one times tokens are used instead of passwords, those are still relying on email for distribution. Think about it - when someone clicks on that magic link or uses one-time password, how do we know that is a real employee and not some hacker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  Enterprises have no way of knowing the identity of employee they are providing access to systems and critical resources.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idemeum-can-help&quot;&gt;idemeum can help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idemeum solves the problem of insecure employee enrollment by providing built-in identity verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blogs/idemeum-verified/verification.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 40%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With idemeum app users can upload the ID document and their photo and quickly verify digital identity. idemeum follows IAL level 2 NIST recommendations. As a result of the verification, all verified identity claims are stored on a mobile device only. No PII is maintained or stored in the idemeum backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  idemeum does not store any user identifiable information in the backend.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that idemeum extends the identity trust beyond just initial identity verification and enrollment. Every time the user authenticates or accesses corporate resources, the identity is assured using idemeum app. Therefore, enterprises can have an assurance that only verified and legitimate user are accessing the resources, and not some hackers who gained access to issues authenticators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security if one of the core principles that is applied to everything we do - mobile, backend, DevOps, it does not matter, security is fundamental and key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more, authentication is mission critical to businesses and individuals. Therefore, we designed idemeum in accordance with the latest best practices as it relates to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security&quot;&gt;CIA triad&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also conducting continuous threat modeling and evaluation to make sure we harden idemeum even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do we keep your data secure?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;idemeum backend&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For idemeum backend we have taken a radical new approach by storing your personal data on your mobile device &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt;. What that means is that we have no users’ digital identity data in our backend. Not only is it important from the privacy standpoint, but it also reduces attack surface significantly. If our backend gets compromised, attackers will get nothing from it, as there is not valuable user data there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;idemeum mobile application&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a mobile side, we are follow general mobile security best practices, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security/&quot;&gt;OWASP Mobile Top 10&lt;/a&gt;, in order to protect idemeum mobile application. We leverage security measures such as hardware based key encryption, jailbreak detection, data encryption, liveness detection and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;idemeum authentication&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;idemeum leverages biometric based authentication that is using biometric sensors on Apple and Google mobile devices. We are using FIDO2 protocol (developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fidoalliance.org&quot;&gt;FIDO Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) that is becoming the de-facto standard in the identity industry. The FIDO Alliance developed FIDO Authentication standards based on public key cryptography for authentication that is more secure than passwords and SMS OTPs, simpler for consumers to use, and easier for service providers to deploy and manage. FIDO Authentication enables password-only logins to be replaced with secure and fast login experiences across websites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we designed idemeum to be 100% privacy enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-default&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;
Unlike any other solution on the market today, any details you add to your digital identity are stored only on your phone only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We do not store any of your data in our backend.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Your data only on mobile device&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create your idemeum identity and add personal details, such as email, phone number, or driver’s license, all information is stored on your mobile device. We leverage state of the art mobile security practices to protect your information, such as storing your data in the secure areas of mobile operating system and using public key encryption to protect your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Anonymized data in the backend&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your application registers with our backend, there is only anonymized data that we use to enable the authentication. We do NOT store any of your personal details, such as email address, phone number, or any information from your IDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nikolay</name></author><summary type="html">Privacy of your data is paramount to us.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">idemeum is how people identify themselves online</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/about-idemeum" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="idemeum is how people identify themselves online" /><published>2020-11-09T16:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-11-09T16:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/about-idemeum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/about-idemeum">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Let's start with the name. We wanted the name of the product to reflect our mission and what we stand for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;idemeum is comprised of two latin words: &lt;i&gt;meum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;idem&lt;/i&gt; that mean &quot;my&quot; and  &quot;identity&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We aspire idemeum to be truly yours. Something that you can own, control, and share only with people and services you choose to. And we want idemeum to be your digital identity. Not some random string of characters that is hard to remember, but your true digital identity that you can use personally and professionally.

        &lt;p&gt;We have spent years in the identity and cyber security space, and yet we could not understand one paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;Digital identity is so critical to everything we do digitally, yet it gets compromised in almost every cyber security breach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every now and then we would hear the news and learn about yet another data breach where identity compromise would be at the core of it. And then we realized - we are not equipped with proper tools to protect our identity. We keep using old inefficient architectures and tools that have been invented years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;First passwords probably arrived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid-1960s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That is when we embraced on a journey to address the problems of &lt;mark&gt;identity privacy&lt;/mark&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;fraud&lt;/mark&gt;, and &lt;mark&gt;passwords.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3 class=&quot;display-4&quot;&gt;Why idemeum enables 100% privacy&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As organizations store user accounts and credentials in centralized databases, hackers compromise these systems and release lists of usernames and passwords on the open web. We have a single point of failure that can be exploited with devastating results. The more we follow the centralized model, the more we sacrifice our privacy and security.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;mark&gt;social login&lt;/mark&gt; you would say? Sounds interesting, but... Are you ok with large social login providers knowing exactly when and where you log into? Knowing what services you use? It is quite a trade off - to forgo your privacy for simplicity and convenience. What is more, if your social account gets locked or disabled, you will lose access to everything you accessed with it.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h3 class=&quot;display-4&quot;&gt;Why idemeum reduces fraud&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Identity fraud is sophisticated and serious. Professional fraudsters work full-time, employing a range of creative and complex techniques to increase efficiencies and maximize profits. The fundamental issue is the issue of online trust - modern internet does not require user to confirm or prove one's identity.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the proliferation of online services grow and enterprises undergo digital transformation, we are facing more and more cases where trust and identity verification are required. Obtaining healthcare, executing financial transactions, or opening accounts governed by KYC regulations - are all cases where identity fraud implications can be devastating.
        &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;We have &lt;mark&gt;&quot;simple strings of characters&quot;&lt;/mark&gt; that can ruin our lives and reveal everything about us. Your email. Your bank account. Your files.
