<p>Privacy of your data is paramount to us.</p>

That is why we designed idemeum to be 100% privacy enabled.

<div class="alert alert-default" role="alert">
Unlike any other solution on the market today, any details you add to your digital identity are stored only on your phone only.<br><br>

We do not store any of your data in our backend.

<h6>Your data only on mobile device</h6>
When you create your idemeum identity and add personal details, such as email, phone number, or driverâ€™s license, all information is stored on your mobile device. We leverage state of the art mobile security practices to protect your information, such as storing your data in the secure areas of mobile operating system and using public key encryption to protect your data.

<h6>Anonymized data in the backend</h6>
When your application registers with our backend, there is only anonymized data that we use to enable the authentication. We do NOT store any of your personal details, such as email address, phone number, or any information from your IDs.
